    SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today reported financial results for its 13-week fiscal fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year ended September 29, 2024. GAAP results in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 include items that are excluded from non-GAAP results.

<p>
    Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights
</p>
<p>
    Global comparable store sales declined 7%, driven by an 8% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 2% increase in average ticket<br>
    North America and U.S. comparable store sales declined 6%, driven by a 10% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket<br>
    International comparable store sales declined 9%, driven by a 5% decline in average ticket and a 4% decline in comparable transactions; China comparable store sales declined 14%, driven by an 8% decline in average ticket and a 6% decline in comparable transactions<br>

    At the end of Q4, stores in the U.S. and China comprised 61% of the company’s global portfolio, with 16,941 and 7,596 stores in the U.S. and China, respectively<br>
    Consolidated net revenues declined 3%, including on a constant currency basis, to $9.1 billion<br>
    GAAP operating margin contracted 380 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%, primarily driven by deleverage, investments in store partner wages and benefits, and increased promotional activity. This contraction was partially offset by pricing and in-store operational efficiencies.<br>

    GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 declined 25% over prior year<br>

    “As shared in our Press Release last week, our results do not reflect the strength of our brand,” commented Rachel Ruggeri, chief financial officer. “I have seen what Starbucks is capable of when we focus on what we do best. I have confidence in our ability to turn around our business and expect we will return to long-term growth,” Ruggeri added.
</p>
<p>
    “It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers. ‘Back to Starbucks’ is that fundamental change,” commented Brian Niccol, chairman and chief executive officer. “My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back. We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth,” Niccol added.
</p>
<p>
    Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Targets
</p>
<p>
    As stated in our October 22, 2024 announcement, given the company’s ceo transition coupled with the current state of the business, guidance is suspended for full fiscal year 2025. We believe this will allow ample opportunity to complete an assessment of the business and solidify key strategies, while stabilizing and positioning the business for long-term growth. The company will provide initial information regarding its new strategies during its Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call starting today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Our October 22, 2024 announcement and accompanying prepared remarks from our chairman and ceo can be accessed on the company's Investor Relations website. The company uses its website as a tool to disclose important information about the company and comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation Fair Disclosure.

</p>
<p>
    Non-GAAP Disclosure
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). When provided to investors, our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses (G&amp;A), non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as management does not believe they contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&amp;A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP earnings per share are G&amp;A, operating income, operating income growth (loss), operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    Non-GAAP Exclusion
</p>
<p>
    Rationale
</p>
<p>
    Restructuring and impairment costs
</p>
<p>
    Management excludes restructuring and impairment costs for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.
</p>
<p>
    Transaction and integration-related costs
</p>
<p>
    Management excludes transaction and integration costs for reasons discussed above. Additionally, we incur certain costs associated with certain divestiture activities. The majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.
</p>
<p>
    Gain on sale of assets
</p>
<p>
    Management excludes the gain related to the sale of assets to Nestlé, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand,

 <a href="story/story1.html">news</a>
 <a href="./sha3_ero.html">list</a>. 
  as these items do not reflect future gains or tax impacts for reasons discussed above.
</p>
<p>
    The Company also presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present the constant currency information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average monthly exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods, excluding related hedging activities. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps users better understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our underlying operating results.
</p>
<p>
    Non-GAAP G&amp;A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income growth (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP earnings per share and constant currency may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
